# 3MF-tools

The primary purpose of this tool was to take Assemblies of multiboard
and print out the BOM so that other people could reproduce the
assembly without violating the multiboard license.

I plan to add additional scripts as I find that I need them.

## 3mf_bom_parser.py 

take a 3mf file and print out a bill of materials
based upon the names of the STL files and print out a Bill of
Materials.
